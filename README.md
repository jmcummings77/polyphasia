## Short Description

Etymological WordNet dataset graph analysis project.

## Overview

This is a project to evaluate an etymology dataset parsed from Wiktionary.org using graph analysis tools. It is mostly an unstructured investigation to see what I can make of the data.

The source data can be downloaded [from the author's website here](https://cs.rutgers.edu/~gd343/downloads/etymwn-20130208.zip).

Initial data parsing and cleaning is handled with pandas, and the lovely networkx package does most of the heavy lifting for the graph algorithms.
